# Help-with-TOOLS.
Recently some people have been asking me for help on RAT tools or other things. This has all been going onto my ActivePorts respiratory. I have created this respiratory so you can ask how to use things or pop by and say hi or something. (note: i may not be online 100% of the time to see your issues.)

How to ask for help here?
- Go post an issue with what tool you need help with, what your problem is, or if you just want to say hi.

How do I add you on Discord?
- I am unlikely to add people on Discord due to ban risks. Please attempt to ask for help in the Issues tab.

I can help with any of these tools:

- Xeno RAT: https://github.com/moom825/xeno-rat
- ASyncRAT: https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp
- dcRAT (maybe): https://github.com/qwqdanchun/DcRat
- Discord RAT 2.0 (moom825): https://github.com/moom825/Discord-RAT-2.0
- Luna-Grabber (still taken down but i just made it work so now i can help with it): https://github.com/Smug246/Luna-Grabber

I CANNOT help with these tools (sorry):

- PySilon-malware (risky to use due to bans, not very good nowadays, very high risks and a lot of errors): https://github.com/mategol/PySilon-malware
- Quasar (really? do I even have to explain why?): https://github.com/quasar/Quasar

What about XWorm/NanoCore/Silver/Sorillus?
- I'd assume they work the same way as most server RAT's.

Ways to contact me:
- Discord (ask for me to add you and i will do so shortly)
- Telegram (dont have account yet but i will manage that soon)
- Email (may put this up here at some point)
- GitHub (make an issue and attempt to ask for help there. if not possible, or you'd prefer other ways of communication, please state what method to use and why and i will follow up shortly)

I do NOT condone unethical hacking or usage of these tools. Only use with consent of other people or on devices that YOU own or VM's. Anything you do with these tools, is not my responsibility and neither is it the responsibility of the creators of these tools. So please, do not RAT or hack people without their consent or knowledge or for unethical purposes. Thank you.

Hope this helps!
